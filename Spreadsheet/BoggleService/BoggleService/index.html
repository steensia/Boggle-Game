    <h1>Boggle API</h1>

    <p>
        The exact response to undefined or malformed HTTP requests is server-dependent and is not specified in this API,
        except to note that some sort of error status code will be included in the response.
    </p>

    <p>
        The response status code 500 (InternalServerError) is used to report, among other things, unhandled exceptions in the
        service.  Sometimes, trying the same service call again will succeed, depending on the nature of the error.
    </p>

    <p>
        The URLs given below are relative to
        <a href="http://cs3500-boggle-s17.azurewebsites.net/BoggleService.svc/">http://cs3500-boggle-s17.azurewebsites.net/BoggleService.svc/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Boggle server keeps track of a set of users, a set of active and completed games, and exactly one pending game.
    </p>

    <p>
        The API makes heavy use of user tokens for authentication.  User tokens are strings that are unique and extremely
        difficult to guess.  This implies that they must be long and randomly generated.  (A good way to generate such a token
        in C# is with Guid.NewGuid().)
    </p>

    <p>
        The API also makes heavy use of game IDs to identify games.  Game IDs are strings that are unique, short, and embeddable
        in the path portion of URLs.  Small, consecutively generated integers are good for this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        A user token is valid if it is non-null and identifies a user.  A game token is valid if it is
        non-null and identifies a game.
    </p>

    <p>
        A user consists of a nickname and a unique user token.  A nickname can be any string, such as "Joe" or "Spike".  A
        nickname does not need to be unique.
    </p>

    <p>
        The pending game has a GameID.  If one player belongs to the pending game, it also has a UserID and a requested time limit.
        Think of it as a game that is waiting for a second player to join.  There is always exactly one pending game.
    </p>

    <p>
        An active or completed game consists of:
        <ul>
            <li>A unique game token.</li>
            <li>
                A game state that is either "active" (game currently being played) or "completed" (game for which time
                has expired).  Any number of games can be active and/or completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                The user tokens of the first and second players to join the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 16-character string that represents the contents of the game board.
            </li>
            <li>
                The time limit of the game, in seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                The time remaining in the game, in seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                The current scores of the two players.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lists of word/score pairs for the two players.  A word/score pair consists of a word that was played and the
                score received for that word.  The words should appear in the order in which they were played.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Create User</h2>

    <p>
        Create a new user.

        <ul>
            <li>
                If Nickname is null, or is empty when trimmed, responds with status 403 (Forbidden).
            </li>
            <li>
                Otherwise, creates a new user with a unique UserToken and the trimmed Nickname.  The returned UserToken
                should be used to identify the user in subsequent requests.  Responds with status
                201 (Created).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Join Game</h2>

    <p>
        Join a game.
        <ul>
            <li>
                If UserToken is invalid, TimeLimit < 5, or TimeLimit > 120,
                responds with status 403 (Forbidden).
            </li>
            <li>
                Otherwise, if UserToken is already a player in the pending game,
                responds with status 409 (Conflict).
            </li>
            <li>
                Otherwise, if there is already one player in the pending game, adds UserToken as
                the second player.  The pending game becomes active and a new pending game with no players
                is created.   The active game's time limit is the integer average of the time limits
                requested by the two players.  Returns the new active game's GameID (which should be the
                same as the old pending game's GameID).  Responds with status 201 (Created).
            </li>
            <li>
                Otherwise, adds UserToken as the first player of the pending game, and the TimeLimit as
                the pending game's requested time limit.  Returns the pending game's GameID.
                Responds with status 202 (Accepted).

            <li>
                Otherwise, records the trimmed Word as being played by UserToken in the game identified by GameID.  Returns
